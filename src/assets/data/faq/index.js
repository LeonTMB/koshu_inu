                In addition to the initial fee plus food and vet expenses, there are many other costs to consider
                when looking at the Koshu Inu price. For starters, a Koshu Inu needs more training than other 
                breeds. It’s no secret that the breed is strong-willed and stubborn. A common phrase among
                Koshu parents is, “A Koshu will do what a Koshu wants.” `

                account the full Koshu Inu price. After all, vet bills aren’t cheap.
                If your dog isn’t spayed or neutered, you should definitely do that right away, unless you have
                plans for breeding. This costs anywhere from $250-$500.
                Long-term, the most common health issues for the Koshu Inu are allergies, glaucoma, cataracts,
                hip dysplasia, entropion and luxating patella
                The KOSHU INU is a breed of hunting dog from Japan. A small-to-medium breed, it is the
                smallest of the six original and distinct spitz breeds of dog native to Japan. A small, alert, and
                agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain and hiking trails, the KOSHU INU was
                originally bred for hunting `

                body: `SafeBTC makes use of a decentralized exchange (DEX). A quick
                explanation of this is that third-party entities responsible for the security
                and transfer of assets are not part of the chain. By the third party, we
                refer to the government of countries, central banks, and other financial
                systems. Power is completely dispersed from such entities and placed in
                the hands of the users
                As a decentralized financial entity, its operations are run by a network of
                users making it very secure. The transactions are confirmed and
                recorded on the Blockchain and not by third parties.
                The vertical and horizontal scaling of the software application creates a
                system that allows for authentication, database, and accounts recording.
                Due to this, there is an elimination of user fees, fraud, and theft. SafeBTC
                runs on the Binance Smart Chain and is currently listed on BSC dex
                exchange: PancakeSwap.`

                body: `Decentralization is not a new concept. When building a technology solution, three primary
                network architectures are typically considered: centralized, distributed, and decentralized. While
                blockchain technologies often make use of decentralized networks, a blockchain application
                itself cannot be categorized simply as being decentralized or not. Rather, decentralization is a
                sliding scale and should be applied to all aspects of a blockchain application. By decentralizing
                the management of and access to resources in an application, greater and fairer service can be
                achieved. Decentralization typically has some tradeoffs such as lower transaction throughput, but
                ideally, the tradeoffs are worth the improved stability and service levels they produce. `
