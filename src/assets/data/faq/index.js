                In addition to the initial fee plus food and vet expenses, there are many other costs to consider
                when looking at the Koshu Inu price. For starters, a Koshu Inu needs more training than other 
                breeds. It’s no secret that the breed is strong-willed and stubborn. A common phrase among
                Koshu parents is, “A Koshu will do what a Koshu wants.” `

                body: `Overall, the Koshu is a healthy breed. This is an important thing to consider if you’re taking into
                account the full Koshu Inu price. After all, vet bills aren’t cheap.
                If your dog isn’t spayed or neutered, you should definitely do that right away, unless you have
                plans for breeding. This costs anywhere from $250-$500.
                Long-term, the most common health issues for the Koshu Inu are allergies, glaucoma, cataracts,
                hip dysplasia, entropion and luxating patella
                The KOSHU INU is a breed of hunting dog from Japan. A small-to-medium breed, it is the
                smallest of the six original and distinct spitz breeds of dog native to Japan. A small, alert, and
                agile dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain and hiking trails, the KOSHU INU was
                originally bred for hunting `

    //             body: `Decentralization is not a new concept. When building a technology solution, three primary
    //             network architectures are typically considered: centralized, distributed, and decentralized. While
    //             blockchain technologies often make use of decentralized networks, a blockchain application
    //             itself cannot be categorized simply as being decentralized or not. Rather, decentralization is a
    //             sliding scale and should be applied to all aspects of a blockchain application. By decentralizing
    //             the management of and access to resources in an application, greater and fairer service can be
    //             achieved. Decentralization typically has some tradeoffs such as lower transaction throughput, but
    //             ideally, the tradeoffs are worth the improved stability and service levels they produce. `
